	<td><p>This system allows you, the examiner, to enter the results for the
	various units of study you are marking as the results become available to
	you.  When you are done the results sheet is emailed to you for printing,
	signing and dating.  This printed copy will be used as the official final
	results sheet for the unit of study!  Once you have signed and dated it
	please deliver it to the Student
	Administration Office (level 4)</p>

	    <li>Click the Login button and then type your login and password into the form at the top of this 
	    page and click "Submit". A new page with a list of 
	    your UoS will be displayed, listing files to be completed separately 
	    from those with INC results to be converted, and those which are 
	    complete.
	    
	    <p><li>Click the link to the UoS you wish to mark and the results sheet 
	    for that UoS will be displayed.
	    <p><li>The list of students for the unit of study will be displayed sorted in
	    alphabetical order by last name.  Enter the results and grades as required. 
	    If you only have some of the results then just enter those and click the
	    "Save" button at the bottom of the page. You can return to this set of results 
	    and add more at a later date.
	    <p><li>Once you have entered all results for the unit of study click "Finish".  This will cause several things
	    to happen!  The results file will be emailed to you, it will be displayed
	    on screen  (do not print this!) and the fact that you are finished will be flagged to the sysadmin by email.  
	    Your access to the file will be withdrawn at this point unless it 
	    contains INC results (see below)
	    <p><li>When you receive the emailed results file you can choose to print 
	    it from the email as is or copy the data and paste it
	    into a spreadsheet (most of you will use MS Excel)
	    <p><li>Print the spreadsheet (or email), sign and date it and deliver it to Student
	    Administration.
	</ol>
	
	<p><b><tt>If the file contains INC results</b> it will stay on the system 
	    but you will only be able to edit the results which need converting. 
	    Please convert these as soon as the results are avilable to you, 
	    print, sign and date and deliver to Student Administration as with 
	    all other results sheets.</tt></p>
